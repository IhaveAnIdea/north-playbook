# Asset Management & Semantic Search Implementation

## Overview

Your North Playbook application now has a comprehensive asset management system that stores each user's uploaded text, audio, and video assets in S3 with their own directory structure and provides powerful semantic search capabilities.

## Key Features Implemented

### üóÇÔ∏è User-Specific Directory Structure
- Each user gets their own isolated directory in S3: `users/{userId}/`
- Organized by category and exercise: `playbook/{category}/{exerciseId}/`
- Timestamp-based naming prevents conflicts: `{timestamp}_{filename}`
- Separate folders for profile assets and temporary uploads

### üè∑Ô∏è Rich Metadata Tagging
- Comprehensive metadata for each asset including:
  - Exercise ID and title
  - Category (mindset, goals, motivation, etc.)
  - Response type (text, audio, video)
  - Mood and custom tags
  - Upload date and file type
  - User-provided descriptions
- Searchable metadata enables powerful filtering

### üîç Advanced Semantic Search
- **Weighted scoring** across multiple fields (title, description, tags, category)
- **Relevance ranking** with exact match and word boundary bonuses
- **Advanced filtering** by category, file type, date range, mood, and tags
- **Multiple sort options** (relevance, date, category, type)
- **Matched field highlighting** shows why results were returned

### üé® Multiple Display Components

#### AssetLibrary Component
- Full-featured asset browser with grid/list views
- Advanced search and filtering interface
- Asset management actions (download, delete)
- Statistics and overview panels
- Detailed asset preview dialogs

#### PlaybookAssetGallery Component
- Integrated playbook view with collapsible interface
- Category-based browsing with visual previews
- Recent assets quick access
- Tabbed interface (All, Images, Videos, Audio)
- Compact mode for embedded use

#### Enhanced ImageGallery Component
- Multiple layout variants (grid, magazine, inline)
- Responsive design with hover effects
- Full-screen preview dialogs
- Download functionality

## Technical Architecture

### Storage Service (`src/lib/storage-service.ts`)
```typescript
// Core upload functionality
await storageService.uploadPlaybookAsset(file, {
  exerciseId: 'mindset-001',
  category: 'mindset',
  tags: ['affirmations', 'morning-routine'],
  description: 'My daily affirmation practice'
});

// Advanced semantic search
const results = await storageService.semanticSearch('affirmations', {
  categories: ['mindset', 'motivation'],
  fileTypes: ['image', 'video'],
  sortBy: 'relevance',
  limit: 20
});

// Asset statistics
const stats = await storageService.getAssetStats();
```

### S3 Bucket Structure
```

‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reflection/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ temp/
```

### Metadata Example
```json
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "exerciseId": "mindset-001",
  "exerciseTitle": "Daily Affirmations",
  "category": "mindset",
  "responseType": "text",
  "mood": "positive",
  "tags": ["affirmations", "morning-routine", "self-love"],
  "uploadDate": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "fileType": "image",
  "originalName": "affirmation_photo.jpg",
  "description": "Visual representation of my daily affirmations"
}
```

## Integration Points
