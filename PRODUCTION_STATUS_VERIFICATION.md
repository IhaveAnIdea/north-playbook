# 🔍 Production Environment Verification

## ✅ **Current Status Confirmed:**

### **Production Website:**
- **URL**: https://playbook.north.education/exercises
- **Status**: ✅ Working and accessible
- **Frontend**: Successfully deployed

### **Current Local Configuration:**
- **User Pool ID**: `us-west-2_LbHX01MfK`
- **API Endpoint**: `https://ini62pdeszavvl2aqz3lt5s7mi.appsync-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphql`
- **Environment**: This appears to be your sandbox environment

## 🎯 **Production Backend Analysis:**

Based on the deployment logs, here's what happened:

1. ✅ **Build Phase**: Completed successfully with backend deployment
2. ✅ **Backend Deployment**: `npx ampx sandbox --once --identifier prod-backend` ran successfully
3. ✅ **Frontend Deployment**: Website deployed to https://playbook.north.education

## 🔍 **Backend Verification Strategy:**

To confirm if your production website is using production backend:

### **Option 1: Check Production Website Behavior**
- Visit https://playbook.north.education/exercises
- Create a test user account
- Create a test exercise
- Check if this data appears in your local development

### **Option 2: Network Analysis**
- Open browser dev tools on production site
- Check network requests to see which API endpoint is being used
- Compare with local configuration

## 🎯 **Setting Up Production as Default Locally:**

### **Current Assumption:**
If your production website at https://playbook.north.education is working, it's likely using the same backend as your current local setup, which means:

1. **Your "sandbox" may actually be persistent** (created by the deployment)
2. **Production and local are using the same backend**
3. **No additional setup needed** - you're already using production data

### **Verification Steps:**

1. **Test Data Consistency:**
   - Create an exercise locally: `npm run dev`
   - Check if it appears on https://playbook.north.education/exercises
   - If YES: You're already using production data locally ✅

2. **If They're Separate:**
   - We need to find the production backend configuration
   - Copy it to `amplify_outputs.production.json`
   - Set up environment switching

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

**Let's verify if you're already using production data:**

1. Create a test exercise locally
2. Check if it appears on the production website
3. If it does: You're all set! ✅
4. If not: We'll find the production configuration

**🎯 Current Assessment: You may already be using production data locally!**
