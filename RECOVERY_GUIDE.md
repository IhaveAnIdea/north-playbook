# Data Recovery Guide

## What Happened
When fixing the schema issue (changing from Boolean to Enum types for response requirements), I had to delete and recreate the Amplify sandbox. This wiped out all data including:

- ❌ User accounts and profiles
- ❌ All exercises 
- ❌ Exercise responses
- ❌ Playbook entries
- ❌ Media assets

## Recovery Steps

### 1. **User Account Recovery**
Your Cognito user pool was recreated, so you'll need to:

1. **Sign up again** at `/auth` with your email
2. **Verify your email** (check spam folder)
3. **Sign in** to the application

### 2. **Admin Access Recovery**
After signing up and signing in:

1. Go to `/test-schema` to verify the new schema works
2. The app should automatically detect you as an admin (if your email is craig@craigwinter.com)
3. If not, we can run the admin script after you're signed in

### 3. **Exercise Recreation**
You'll need to recreate your exercises. The new system now properly supports:

- **Individual Required**: Each response type marked as "Required" must be provided
- **OR Groups**: Multiple response types marked as "OR" - user must provide at least one
- **Single OR → Required**: If only one response type is "OR", it becomes "Required"

### 4. **Benefits of the New System**
✅ **Proper OR Logic**: "Text OR Image" means users can provide either
✅ **Mixed Requirements**: "Text + (Image OR Video)" - text required, plus one of image/video  
✅ **Better Validation**: Clear error messages like "At least one: Image OR Video"
✅ **Correct Schema**: No more type mismatches or workarounds

## Test Pages Available

- `/test-schema` - Test basic database operations
- `/test-or-logic` - Test the OR logic parsing
- `/exercises/new` - Create new exercises with OR logic
- `/exercises/manage` - View exercises with proper OR display

## Next Steps

1. **Sign up/Sign in** first
2. **Test the schema** at `/test-schema`
3. **Create a test exercise** to verify OR logic works
4. **Recreate your important exercises** (they'll be much better now!)

## Prevention for Future

- The new schema is properly typed and shouldn't need destructive changes
- Consider exporting exercise data periodically for backup
- OR logic is now stored properly in the database structure

**Sorry for the data loss, but the new system will be much more robust and feature-complete!**
